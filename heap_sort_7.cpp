//short notes on some tree concepts

//full binary binary tree
//binary tree with maximum number of nodes is a full binary tree
//it can have at the max of 2^(h+1)-1 nodes

//complete binary tree
//in a complete binary tree, we start filling from the left side of the tree
//and basically when we fill an array using that analogy, no spaces are left

//heap is always a complete binary tree
//max heap is a binary tree in which the parent node is always greater than child node


//height of a complete binary tree is log n


//now for insertion in a maxheap, the time taken for insertion in a heap is 
//minimum of O(1) [if the element inserted is very small, that it doesn't need and swaping with the parent]
//maximum time required is O(log n) [if the element is worthy of becoming the root of the tree]
